## The Story So Far

I started coding because I wanted to build things that mattered. Not just apps that work, but experiences that feel *right*—the kind where users don't have to think twice about where to tap or what comes next.

Today, I spend my days crafting mobile and web applications that balance performance with personality. I believe the best code is the kind that future-me (or future-you) can read without needing a decoder ring.

```javascript
const journey = {
  started: "with curiosity",
  driven_by: "solving real problems",
  obsessed_with: ["clean code", "smooth UX", "apps that just work"],
  currently: "shipping features, learning daily, breaking things (responsibly)"
};
```

## What I Work With

I don't just pick tools because they're trendy—I choose what gets the job done without making life harder later.

**On the frontend**, I build with **React** and **React Native**, bringing ideas to life across mobile and web with **TypeScript** keeping things predictable.

**On the backend**, I reach for **Node.js**, **FastAPI**, and **Flask** depending on what the project needs—speed, simplicity, or scale.

**Behind the scenes**, I rely on **Git** for version control, **Drizzle ORM** for databases that don't make me cry, and **REST APIs** to connect it all. I ship to **Vercel** when I want something live yesterday.

## How I Build

I don't believe in perfect code, but I do believe in code that doesn't make you want to quit your job six months later. Here's what guides me:

- **Clarity over cleverness** — If it needs a comment to explain, it probably needs a rewrite
- **Users over features** — Fancy tech means nothing if the experience feels clunky
- **Iteration over perfection** — Ship, learn, improve, repeat
- **Practical solutions** — The best code solves actual problems, not imaginary ones
